{"name":"UE4GitPlugin","tagline":"GitSourceControl UE4 Plugin (beta, now integrated into UE4.7)","body":"Unreal Engine 4 Git Source Control Plugin\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUE4GitPlugin is a simple Git Source Control Plugin for Unreal Engine - It has been integrated in UE4.7 in \"Beta\".\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nThis Git Source Control Plugin is now part of the default Unreal Engine 4.7\r\n\r\nBeta version 0.6.3:\r\n- initialize a new Git local repository ('git init') to manage your UE4 Game Project.\r\n- display status icons to show modified/added/deleted/untracked files\r\n- show history of a file\r\n- diff against depot or between previous versions of a file\r\n- revert modifications of a file\r\n- add a file\r\n- delete a file\r\n- checkin/commit a file (cannot handle atomically more than 20 files)\r\n- show current branch name in status text\r\n\r\n#### What *cannot* be done presently (TODO list for v1.0, ordered by priority):\r\n- solve a merge conflict\r\n- merge blueprints\r\n- add localisation for git specific messages\r\n- migrate an asset should add it to the destination project if also under Git (needs management of 'out of tree' files)\r\n- displaying states of 'Engine' assets (also needs management of 'out of tree' files)\r\n- tags: implement ISourceControlLabel to manage git tags\r\n- .uproject file state si not visible in the current Editor\r\n- Branch is not in the current Editor workflow (but on Epic Roadmap)\r\n- Pull/Fetch/Push are not in the current Editor workflow\r\n- Amend a commit is not in the current Editor workflow\r\n- configure user name & email ('git config user.name' & git config user.email')\r\n\r\n#### Known issues:\r\n- the Editor does not show deleted files (only when deleted externaly?)\r\n- the Editor does not show missing files\r\n- issue #22: A Move/Rename leaves a redirector file behind\r\n- issue #11: Add the \"Resolve\" operation introduced in Editor 4.3\r\n- improve the 'Init' window text, hide it if connection is already done, auto connect\r\n- reverting an asset does not seem to update content in Editor! Issue in Editor?\r\n- file history does not report file size\r\n- standard Editor commit dialog ask if user wants to \"Keep Files Checked Out\" => no use for Git or Mercurial CanCheckOut()==false\r\n- Windows only (64 bits) -> Mac compiles but needs testing/debugging (Linux source control is not supported by Editor)\r\n\r\n#### Wishlist (after v1.0):\r\n- [git-annexe and/or git-media - #1 feature request](https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin/issues/1)\r\n\r\n#### In-code TODO list (internal roadmap):\r\n\r\n- FGitConnectWorker::Execute (While project not in Git source control)\r\n  Improve error message \"You should check out a working copy...\"\r\n  => double error message (and in reverse order) with \"Project is not part of a Git working copy\"\r\n\r\n- FGitResolveWorker (GitSourceControlOperations.h)\r\n  git add to mark a conflict as resolved\r\n  \r\n- FGitSourceControlRevision::GetBranchSource() const\r\n  if this revision was copied from some other revision, then that source revision should\r\n\tbe returned here (this should be determined when history is being fetched)\r\n- FGitSourceControlState::GetBaseRevForMerge()\r\n  get revision of the merge-base (https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge-base.html)\r\n\t\r\n- FGitConnectWorker::Execute()\r\n  popup to propose to initialize the git repository \"git init + .gitignore\"\r\n\r\n- FGitSyncWorker (GitSourceControlOperations.h)\r\n  git fetch remote(s) to be able to show files not up-to-date with the serveur\r\n- FGitSourceControlState::IsCurrent() const\r\n  check the state of the HEAD versus the state of tracked branch on remote\r\n\r\n- FGitSourceControlRevision::GetFileSize() const\r\n\tgit log does not give us the file size, but we could run a specific command\r\n\r\n- GitSourceControlUtils::CheckGitAvailability\r\n  also check Git config user.name & user.email\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n- GitSourceControlUtils::FindGitBinaryPath\r\n  use the Windows registry to find Git\r\n\r\nMac:\r\n- GitSourceControlUtils::RunCommandInternalRaw\r\n  Specifying the working copy (the root) of the git repository (before the command itself)\r\n\tdoes not work in UE4.1 on Mac if there is a space in the path (\"/Users/xxx/Unreal Project/MyProject\")\r\n\r\nBug reports?\r\n- FGitSourceControlRevision::Get\r\n  Bug report: a counter is needed to avoid overlapping files; temp files are not (never?) released by Editor!\r\n\r\n- GitSourceControlUtils::UpdateCachedStates\r\n  // State->TimeStamp = InState.TimeStamp; // Bug report: Workaround a bug with the Source Control Module not updating file state after a \"Save\"\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\n#### Install Git\r\n\r\nUnder Windows 64bits, you could either:\r\n- install a standalone Git, usually in \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\\git.exe\".\r\n- or copy a [portable Git](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?can=1&q=PortableGit)\r\ninside \"<UnrealEngine>/Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/git/Win32\".\r\n\r\n#### Initialize your Game Project directory with Git\r\n\r\nUse your favorite Git program to initialize and manage your whole game project directory.\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:/Users/<username>/Documents/Unreal Projects/<YourGameProject>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Install this Git Plugin\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to use a Plugin with UE4.\r\n\r\nSee also the [Plugins official Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Plugins/index.html)\r\n\r\n##### Within a standard installed Unreal Engine binary release:\r\n\r\nYou can simply [download a ZIP of source code from the latest release](https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin/releases),\r\nand unzip it under the \"Plugins\" directory of the Engine, beside PerforceSourceControl and SubversionSourceControl:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<UnrealEngineInstallation>/4.1/Engine/Plugins/Developer\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can clone the plugin repository, and as the name of the destination directory is unimportant, its just:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Within an Unreal Engine source release from GitHub:\r\n\r\nDonwload and unzip or clone the plugin repository under the \"Plugins\" directory of the Engine, beside PerforceSourceControl and SubversionSourceControl:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<UnrealEngineClone>/Engine/Plugins/Developer\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake care to use **GitSourceControl** as the name of the destination directory (same name as the \"GitSourceControl.uplugin\" file):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin.git GitSourceControl\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Within your Game Project only\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could choose to install the plugin into a subfolder or your Game Project \"Plugins\" directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<YourGameProject>/Plugins\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, you will obviously only be able to use the plugin within this project.\r\n\r\n#### Enable Git Plugin within the Editor\r\n\r\nLaunch the UE4 Editor, then open:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWindows->Plugins, enable Editor->Source Control->Git\r\n```\r\n\r\nclick Enable and restart the Editor.\r\n\r\n#### Activate Git Source Control for your Game Project\r\n\r\nLoad your Game Project, then open:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile->Connect To Source Control... -> Git: Accept Settings\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also the [Source Control official Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/UI/SourceControl/index.html)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014-2015 Sebastien Rombauts (sebastien.rombauts@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nDistributed under the MIT License (MIT) (See accompanying file LICENSE.txt\r\nor copy at http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n### GitHub website\r\nThe most efficient way to help and contribute to this wrapper project is to\r\nuse the tools provided by GitHub:\r\n- please fill bug reports and feature requests here: https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin/issues\r\n- fork the repository, make some small changes and submit them with independent pull-requests\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nYou can also email me directly, I will answer any questions and requests.\r\n\r\n### Coding Style Guidelines\r\nThe source code follow the UnreaEngine official [Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Development/CodingStandard/index.html) :\r\n- CamelCase naming convention, with a prefix letter to differentiate classes ('F'), interfaces ('I'), templates ('T')\r\n- files (.cpp/.h) are named like the class they contains\r\n- Doxygen comments, documentation is located with declaration, on headers\r\n- Use portable common features of C++11 like nullptr, auto, range based for, override keyword\r\n- Braces on their own line\r\n- Tabs to indent code, with a width of 4 characters\r\n\r\n## See also\r\n\r\n- [Git Source Control Tutorial on the Wikis](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Git_source_control_(Tutorial))\r\n- [UE4 Git Plugin website](http://srombauts.github.com/UE4GitPlugin)\r\n\r\n- [ue4-hg-plugin for Mercurial (and bigfiles)](https://github.com/enlight/ue4-hg-plugin)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
