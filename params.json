report file size\r\n- Windows only (64 bits)\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\n#### Install Git\r\n\r\nUnder Windows 64bits, you could either:\r\n- install a standalone Git, usually in \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\\git.exe\".\r\n- or copy a [portable Git](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?can=1&q=PortableGit)\r\ninside \"<UnrealEngine>/Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/git/Win32\".\r\n\r\n#### Initialize your Game Project directory with Git\r\n\r\nUse your favorite Git program to initialize and manage your whole game project directory.\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:/Users/<username>/Documents/Unreal Projects/<YourGameProject>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Install this Git Plugin\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to use a Plugin with UE4.\r\n\r\nSee also the [Plugins official Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Plugins/index.html)\r\n\r\n##### Within a standard installed Unreal Engine binary release:\r\n\r\nYou can simply [download a ZIP of source code from the latest release](https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin/releases),\r\nand unzip it under the \"Plugins\" directory of the Engine, beside PerforceSourceControl and SubversionSourceControl:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<UnrealEngineInstallation>/4.1/Engine/Plugins/Developer\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can clone the plugin repository, and as the name of the destination directory is unimportant, its just:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Within an Unreal Engine source release from GitHub:\r\n\r\nDonwload and unzip or clone the plugin repository under the \"Plugins\" directory of the Engine, beside PerforceSourceControl and SubversionSourceControl:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<UnrealEngineClone>/Engine/Plugins/Developer\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake care of using the name **GitSourceControl** as destination directory (same name as the \"GitSourceControl.uplugin\" file):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin.git GitSourceControl\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Within your Game Project only\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could choose to install the plugin into a subfolder or your Game Project \"Plugins\" directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<YourGameProject>/Plugins\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, you will obviously only be able to use the plugin within this project.\r\n\r\n#### Enable Git Plugin within the Editor\r\n\r\nLaunch the UE4 Editor, then open:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWindows->Plugins, enable Editor->Source Control->Git\r\n```\r\n\r\nclick Enable and restart the Editor.\r\n\r\n#### Activate Git Source Control for your Game Project\r\n\r\nLoad your Game Project, then open:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile->Connect To Source Control... -> Git: Accept Settings\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also the [Source Control official Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/UI/SourceControl/index.html)\r\n\r\n###
